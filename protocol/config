recv data
control[1] == '0'
des_ip == local_ip
des_port == local_port

recv ack
control[1] == '1'
des_ip == local_ip
des_port == local_port

send data
control[1] == '0'
des_ip != local_ip
des_port != local_port

send ack
control[1] == '1'
des_ip != local_ip
des_port != local_port

error packet
src_ip == des_ip
src_port == des_port

all modules can't modify the packet's ip and port information and ack flag
except lost_packet_module and modify_module

the lost_packet_module maybe simulate packet loss by making 
src_ip == des_ip and src_port == des_port

the modify_module is the last module before sending packet, it needs to modify 
des_ip = src_ip and des_port = src_port
src_ip = local_ip and src_port = local_port
set ack flag if needed
